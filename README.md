# ReadSpeed

ReadSpeed is an app that records your reading speed.

When the app begins, if you have any stored scores, it will display your most recent score and your average score.

When you press "Begin", it shows you text from a website (specifically the "Article of the Day" portion of Wikipedia) and the clock starts.
When you press "Finished", your reading speed is presented to you.

The three dots in the top right/on the toolbar serve as the Options Menu.

<b>Settings</b> currently holds the Dark Theme switcher.

<b>Scores</b> shows stored scores that do persist through app opening/closing. You can clear your stored scores here.

Some future versions will allow selective score tracking, user-input paragraphs for reading speed tests, etc.
