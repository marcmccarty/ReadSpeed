# ReadSpeed

ReadSpeed is a basic app that records your reading speed.

When you press "Begin", it shows you text from a website and the clock starts.
When you press "Finished", your reading speed is presented to you.

Some future versions will ideally store reading speeds, use variable websites, etc.
