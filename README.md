# ReadSpeed

ReadSpeed is a basic app that records your reading speed.

When you press "Begin", it shows you text from a website (specifically the "Article of the Day" portion of Wikipedia) and the clock starts.
When you press "Finished", your reading speed is presented to you.

Some future versions will ideally store reading speeds, use variable websites, etc.
